# GameOfLife

#### Description
This project is a game about “Conway’s game of life” using C language and the SDL2library. Based on the original rules, the project displays the animations of each evolution step in a window, white blocks replacing alive cells and black blocks replacing dead cells. Each game needs a file to load the initial state of the world and another file to record the last state of the world.
